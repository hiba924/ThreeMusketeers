# ThreeMusketeers
3 Musketeers Java game that can be played against a computer or another player
The game starts with a 5 by 5 board. 

There are 3 musketeer pieces that are placed in the middle, top right corner and bottom left corner. The rest are occupied by the guard pieces (enemy).

The musketeer always goes first and can move to any orthogonal piece occupied by an enemy. The enemy piece is then removed.

The guard piece can move to any orthogonal empty spot. 

How to win:

The guard wins if it forces all the musketeers into the same row or column.

The musketeers win if they have no more moves left and are not all in the same row or column.
